              description: |-
                A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes. The main way we use constructors in Spigot plugins is to allow classes to reference the Main class.

                We’ll start out with our main class titled Main and another class titled TutorialClass.

                The format for constructors is:
                `public ClassName(args)`

                In this case, it would look like this:
                `public TutorialClass(Main m) {`
                The argument being the main class. Now, whenever a TutorialClass is created it will require a Main class.

                So our code for the TutorialClass will look like this
                ```java
                public class TutorialClass {

                    private Main main;

                    public TutorialClass(Main main) {
                        this.main = main;
                    }

                }```
                And when creating the TutorialClass we now only need to do `new TutorialClass(this);`

                This will eliminate the need for static variables and is overall good practice.

                How to debug code
                ```md
                1. Establish your goal.
                # To fix your problem it is first important that you know what you want to do.```
                ```md
                2. Identify the problem.
                # This is often the hardest step. But it is the most important. "My plugin isn't working" is not a problem. "My plugin isn't loading" or "My listener isn't working" is a good example of a problem. ```
                ```md
                3. Isolate the problem.
                # Once you have identified the problem, it is important to locate what is causing it. Having an exception that prints a stacktrace to the console is probably the easiest way to find out the problem. Whenever you have a bug, make sure to check console for any errors. See the bottom for more info.```
                ```md
                4. Fix the problem
                # Once you have identified the problem, and tracked the origin of it, that is when you should begin to fix it. If you can't think of a fix, don't be afraid to ask the discord or google.```
                ```md
                5. Test it.
                # Whenever you edit your code, test it, and if there's still an issue, go through steps 1-5 again```

                **Whenever you get help or give help to someone you may notice that all 5 of these things are required to fix the problem. If you're asking for help, try to go through steps one and 2 so that you can get better help.**


                Below is an example of going through the process, (The code could be optimized quite a bit, but I'll stick to this so it is easier to understand for more people)

                <https://pastebin.com/19Hj5nUr>
                ```md
                1. I want to make a command that will send a message to the player containing all of the arguments. For example "/tellme this is a test command" will send the player a message of "this is a test command"```
                ```md
                2. When I run the command nothing happens.```

                Now that we know what we're trying to do, and we know what is happening, we need to identify the problem. The first step would be to look in console for a stack trace. If there isn't a stack trace, that's when we start using the most important method in Java; System.out.println(); We can modify our onCommand method to include these debug messages like so:
                <https://pastebin.com/Whj3C9dc>

                If we run this and type the command /tellme test We would see this in the console.
                ```Command sent
                tellme
                false```

                That means that the if statement on line 5 is false.

                ```md
                3. label.equalsIgnoreCase("telme") is false```
                Now looking at what we're comparing, the label for the command being run is tellme and we are comparing it to telme. This problem is caused just by a typo.
                ```md
                4. Replace  "if (label.equalsIgnoreCase("telme"))" with "if (label.equalsIgnoreCase("tellme"))"```
                ```md
                5. "/tellme test message" sends a message of "An internal error occured while attempting to perform this command"```
                Now we go through steps 1-5 again.
                If we go look at the console we will see an error that would look something like <https://pastebin.com/4byGYQhwWhen> looking at the log we can see the issue is caused on line 9 of the main class.
                We can fix it by replacing the <= with < in the for loop. For more info on reading debug logs you can visit <https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/fixing-plugin-problems-easily-reading-stacktraces/>

                How HashMaps work in Java
                ```java
                Map<Key, Value> example = new HashMap<>();```
                HashMaps have two things a key and a value. You call the key and get the value it is holding.
                key -- > value

                ```java
                Map<String, Integer> playersBalance = new HashMap<>();```

                The hashmap above is a <String, Integer> meaning it will hold a string that corresponds to a certain Integer.
                For example lets store player's balances in this hashmap. To do this you can do the following code:
                ```java
                playerBalance.put("CodedRed", 10000);
                playerBalance.put("Insprill", 5003);
                playerBalance.put("danc", 4665);
                playerBalance.put("Deerjump", 3761);
                ```
                You can store as many different pairs of information you want in a hashmap. However, if you try to put value in with the same key name then it will overwrite the old key. Hence, you cannot have the same key names.

                key returns the value so...
                Our info in the hashmap look like this:
                `CodedRed --> 10000`
                `Insprill --> 5003`
                `danc --> 4665`
                `Deerjump --> 3761`

                Say we wanted to get someone's balance:
                ```java
                if (playerBalance.containsKey("CodedRed"))
                int money = playerBalance.get("CodedRed");```
                If you try to get a value with a key that doesn't exist, it will simply return `null`.

                __**Basic Listener Help**__

                Listeners are required when you are dealing with events!
                They are handled in different ways depending on if you are working on an event in your *Main class* or *another separate class*!

                **First Step**
                First make sure to have `implements Listener` at the top of the class which has your event. Example:
                ```java
                public class MyClass implements Listener {
                ```

                **Second Step**
                Register the event!
                In your onEnable you must register the event. To do so you must call upon the classes constructor.
                __*Registering an event that is in your main class:*__
                ```java
                public void onEnable() {
                    this.getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, this);
                }
                ```
                __*Registering an event that is in a separate class:*__
                ```java
                public void onEnable() {
                    this.getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new MyClass(), this);
                }
                ```
                In this example "MyClass()" is the name of the java class that has my event.

                **Third Step**
                Make sure to have `@EventHandler` above the event method! Example:
                ```java
                @EventHandler
                public void onClick(PlayerInteractEvent event) {

                }
                ```
                **Hope this helped!**

            }```
            Non-static methods and variables in this class can then be accessed with `ClassName.getInstance()...`.
            If you want to use this in your main class, then remove the ` = new ClassName()` part and put `instance = this;` in your `onLoad` or `onEnable`.
            Note that this isn't best practice and you should use dependency injection. Run `/constructor` to view examples.

                  When using `authors`, it must be defined as a list. For example,
                  ```yaml
                  authors: [ Insprill ]
                  ```or

                    - Insprill
                  ```
                  If you only have a single author, you can use `author` instead and define it normally.
                  ```yaml
                  author: Insprill
                  ```

                  API versions are *major* versions from 1.13 and up. (e.g. `1.13`, `1.14`, `1.15`, etc). Anything below 1.13 is not valid.
                  Older versions didn't have this field, so specifying it won't hurt anything. A plugin with a 1.13 API version will gladly run on a 1.12 server.

                  If you have it specified and are still getting this error, you most likely have a typo. Double, triple, and quadruple check the package and class name you provided matches the actual name of the package and class name.

                description: |-
                  Before blindly casting a command's sender to a player, you need to check if it actually *is* a player!

                  You can use a simple `instanceof` check for this.
                  ```java
                  if (sender instanceof Player) {
                    // Do the thing
                  }
                  ```
                  If your command should only be able to be run by players, you can fast-fail with the following code at the top of your command.
                  ```java
                  if (!(sender instanceof Player)) {
                    sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + "This command can only be executed as a player!");
                    return true;

                  To get a Player from an OfflinePlayer, you must use the `#getPlayer` method.
                  If the player isn't online, this will return null.
                  You can check if the player is online with `#isOnline`.

                  For example:
                  ```java
                  OfflinePlayer offlinePlayer = ...
                  if (!offlinePlayer.isOnline()) {
                    return;

                description: |-
                  If you're extending JavaPlugin in more than one class, or are calling `new` on your main class, stop!

                  Instead, what you want to do, is pass in an instance of your main class to whatever other class needs it.
                  ```java
                  private final JavaPlugin plugin;
                  public ClassName(JavaPlugin plugin) {
                    this.plugin = plugin;
                  }
                  ```With this, you can access all the normal JavaPlugin methods off of the `plugin` parameter. (e.g. `plugin.getConfig()`).

                  If you have something specific in your main class you need to access, you can replace `JavaPlugin` with the name of your class.
                  When you create a new instance of this class from your main class, you will now have to pass in `this` to the constructor like so: `new ClassName(this);`.

                  Your main class must be defined as `public`. This can be done by adding `public` infront of `class`.

                  If your main class is already public, it must also have a public constructor!
                  By default it will already have a public constructor unless you've explicitly added a private one.

                  Your main class must have a default constructor. This is a public constructor with no parameters.
                  By default, your main class will already have one of these unless you define a custom one for use with something like [MockBukkit](https://github.com/MockBukkit/MockBukkit).

                  If that's the case, you can re-add the default constructor with the following code:
                  ```java
                  public MyPlugin() {
                  }

                    - SomeOtherPlugin
                  ```
                  If your plugin *can* function without the other plugin on the server, add it to the `softDepend` list.
                  ```yaml
                  softDepend:

                  The general rule-of-thumb is for 1.8-1.16 your plugin should be compiled with Java 8. For 1.17, it should be compiled with Java 16. For anything newer, it should be compiled with Java 17.

                  You can find out what version of Java you have by running `java -version` in a terminal.
